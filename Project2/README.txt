This file contains instructions for running the executable application files of Project2.

To generate file <input_file_name>change.txt with the results of running <input_file_name>.txt against each of the three algorithms, run:

$ python app.py

Please note that problems of A > 30 do not generate results for changeslow, as it is not efficient enough to complete in a timely manner

To generate the experimental data files used in problems 4-8, run:

$ python experiment.py

The output appears in files labled Problem<#>Output.csv

Run clean.bat to clear output files with:

$ ./clean.bat
